*Purpose*: When designing structures such as bridges, boats, and planes,
the design team needs data about *material properties*. Often when we
engineers first learn about material properties through coursework, we
talk about abstract ideas and look up values in tables without ever
looking at the data that gave rise to published properties. In this
challenge you’ll study an aluminum alloy dataset: Studying these data
will give you a better sense of the challenges underlying published
material values.

In this challenge, you will load a real dataset, wrangle it into tidy
form, and perform EDA to learn more about the data.

*Background*: In 1946, scientists at the Bureau of Standards tested a
number of Aluminum plates to determine their
[elasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_modulus) and
[Poisson’s ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson%27s_ratio).
These are key quantities used in the design of structural members, such
as aircraft skin under [buckling
loads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckling). These scientists tested
plats of various thicknesses, and at different angles with respect to
the [rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_\(metalworking\))
direction.

# Loading and Wrangle

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

The `readr` package in the Tidyverse contains functions to load data
form many sources. The `read_csv()` function will help us load the data
for this challenge.

``` r
## NOTE: If you extracted all challenges to the same location,
## you shouldn't have to change this filename
filename <- "./data/stang.csv"

## Load the data
df_stang <- read_csv(filename)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   thick = col_double(),
    ##   E_00 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_00 = col_double(),
    ##   E_45 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_45 = col_double(),
    ##   E_90 = col_double(),
    ##   mu_90 = col_double(),
    ##   alloy = col_character()
    ## )

``` r
df_stang
```

    ## # A tibble: 9 x 8
    ##   thick  E_00 mu_00  E_45  mu_45  E_90 mu_90 alloy  
    ##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  
    ## 1 0.022 10600 0.321 10700  0.329 10500 0.31  al_24st
    ## 2 0.022 10600 0.323 10500  0.331 10700 0.323 al_24st
    ## 3 0.032 10400 0.329 10400  0.318 10300 0.322 al_24st
    ## 4 0.032 10300 0.319 10500  0.326 10400 0.33  al_24st
    ## 5 0.064 10500 0.323 10400  0.331 10400 0.327 al_24st
    ## 6 0.064 10700 0.328 10500  0.328 10500 0.32  al_24st
    ## 7 0.081 10000 0.315 10000  0.32   9900 0.314 al_24st
    ## 8 0.081 10100 0.312  9900  0.312 10000 0.316 al_24st
    ## 9 0.081 10000 0.311    -1 -1      9900 0.314 al_24st

Note that these data are not tidy\! The data in this form are convenient
for reporting in a table, but are not ideal for analysis.

**q1** Tidy `df_stang` to produce `df_stang_long`. You should have
column names `thick, alloy, angle, E, mu`. Make sure the `angle`
variable is of correct type. Filter out any invalid values.

*Hint*: You can reshape in one `pivot` using the `".value"` special
value for `names_to`.

``` r
## TASK: Tidy `df_stang`
df_stang_long <-
  df_stang %>%
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = c(".value", "angle"),
    names_sep = "_",
    cols = c(-thick, -alloy)
  ) %>%
  mutate(angle = as.integer(angle)) %>%
  filter(mu >= 0)

df_stang_long
```

    ## # A tibble: 26 x 5
    ##    thick alloy   angle     E    mu
    ##    <dbl> <chr>   <int> <dbl> <dbl>
    ##  1 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.321
    ##  2 0.022 al_24st    45 10700 0.329
    ##  3 0.022 al_24st    90 10500 0.31 
    ##  4 0.022 al_24st     0 10600 0.323
    ##  5 0.022 al_24st    45 10500 0.331
    ##  6 0.022 al_24st    90 10700 0.323
    ##  7 0.032 al_24st     0 10400 0.329
    ##  8 0.032 al_24st    45 10400 0.318
    ##  9 0.032 al_24st    90 10300 0.322
    ## 10 0.032 al_24st     0 10300 0.319

# EDA

<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

## Initial checks

<!-- ------------------------- -->

**q2** Perform a basic EDA on the aluminum data *without visualization*.
Use your analysis to answer the questions under *observations* below. In
addition, add your own question that you’d like to answer about the
data.

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  summarize(n_distinct(alloy), n_distinct(angle), n_distinct(thick))
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 3
    ##   `n_distinct(alloy)` `n_distinct(angle)` `n_distinct(thick)`
    ##                 <int>               <int>               <int>
    ## 1                   1                   3                   4

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  group_by(thick) %>%
  summarize(mean(E), mean(mu))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 4 x 3
    ##   thick `mean(E)` `mean(mu)`
    ##   <dbl>     <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1 0.022    10600       0.323
    ## 2 0.032    10383.      0.324
    ## 3 0.064    10500       0.326
    ## 4 0.081     9975       0.314

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  group_by(angle) %>%
  summarize(mean(E), mean(mu))
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 3 x 3
    ##   angle `mean(E)` `mean(mu)`
    ##   <int>     <dbl>      <dbl>
    ## 1     0    10356.      0.320
    ## 2    45    10362.      0.324
    ## 3    90    10289.      0.320

**Observations**:

  - Is there “one true value” for the material properties of Aluminum?
    No, because both the modulus of elasticity AND Poisson’s ratio vary.

  - How many aluminum alloys were tested? How do you know? One alloy. I
    used the summarize function with “n\_distinct”. (Also I looked at
    every row of the table to double check, and the alloy name is always
    the same.)

  - What angles were tested? 3 angles: 0 degrees, 45 degrees, and 90
    degrees.

  - What thicknesses were tested? 4 thicknesses: 0.022, 0.032, 0.064,
    0.081 (inches).

  - I wonder whether the values of E and mu vary with thickness, or with
    the angle.

## Visualize

<!-- ------------------------- -->

**q3** Create a visualization to investigate your question from q1
above. Can you find an answer to your question using the dataset? Would
you need additional information to answer your question?

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mu, y = E, color = as.factor(thick)), size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Modulus of Elasticity by Poisson's Ratio and Thickness",
    x = "Poisson's Ratio (mu)",
    y = "Modulus of Elasticity (E, ksi)"
    ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "GnBu", name = "Thickness (in)")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task,%20thickness-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - The thickest aluminum (0.081") has the lowest modulus of
    elasticity–all 10,100 or less, whereas all other thicknesses were
    greater than 10,250.
  - The thinnest aluminum (0.022") has the highest modulus of
    elasticity–all 10,500 or greater.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = E, fill = as.factor(thick))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="GnBu", name = "Thickness (in)")  +
  labs(
    title = "Modulus of Elasticity and Thickness",
    x = "Modulus of Elasticity (E, ksi)",
    y = "Count"
    ) 
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task,%20thickness%20and%20E-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = thick, y = E, group = thick)) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="GnBu")  +
  labs(
    title = "Modulus of Elasticity and Thickness",
    x = "Thickness",
    y = "Modulus of Elasticity (E, ksi)"
    ) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10500, linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
  annotate("text", label = "Reported Modulus of Elasticity", x = 0.047, y = 10530, color = "blue")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task,%20thickness%20and%20E,%20boxplot-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - The relationship between thickness and the modulus of elasticity is
    even clearer here.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = mu, fill = as.factor(thick))) +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette="GnBu", name = "Thickness (in)")  +
  labs(
    title = "Poisson's Ratio and Thickness",
    x = "Poisson's Ratio (mu)",
    y = "Count"
    )
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task,%20thickness%20and%20mu-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - There is not such a clean relationship here, but Poisson’s Ratio
    (mu) perhaps bears some relationship to thickness, in that thicker
    aluminum tended to have a lower value for mu.
  - The thinnest aluminum has the largest variation in mu.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
## TASK: Investigate your question from q1 here
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = mu, y = E, color = as.factor(angle)), size = 3) +
  labs(
    title = "Modulus of Elasticity by Poisson's Ratio and Angle",
    x = "Poisson's Ratio (mu)",
    y = "Modulus of Elasticity (E, ksi)"
    ) +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Angle (degrees)")
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q3-task,%20angle-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

\-The angle with respect to the rolling direction does not seem to have
a relationship to either E or mu.

**q4** Consider the following statement:

“A material’s property (or material property) is an intensive property
of some material, i.e. a physical property that does not depend on the
amount of the material.”\[2\]

Note that the “amount of material” would vary with the thickness of a
tested plate. Does the following graph support or contradict the claim
that “elasticity `E` is an intensive material property.” Why or why not?
Is this evidence *conclusive* one way or another? Why or why not?

``` r
## NOTE: No need to change; run this chunk
df_stang_long %>%
  ggplot(aes(mu, E, color = as_factor(thick))) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](c03-stang-assignment_files/figure-gfm/q4-vis-1.png)<!-- -->

**Observations**:

  - Does this graph support or contradict the claim above? Contradict;
    there is clearly a relationship between E and thickness.
  - Is it conclusive? I’m not sure–I wouldn’t consider it conclusive
    anyway, not without learning more. I assume that in the
    manufacturing process, there is some amount of variatiability that
    is expected, and without knowing about that range, I couldn’t say if
    these values are falling outside of that range, and really making us
    question everything we know. I would guess these are “close enough,”
    but haven’t had time to do any research on this.
