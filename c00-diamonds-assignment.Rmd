*Purpose*: Throughout this course, you'll complete a large number of *exercises* and *challenges*. Exercises are meant to introduce content with easy-to-solve problems, while challenges are meant to make you think more deeply about and apply the content. The challenges will start out highly-scaffolded, and become progressively open-ended.

In this challenge, you will go through the process of exploring, documenting, and sharing an analysis of a dataset. We will use these skills again and again in each challenge.

# Grading Rubric
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

Unlike exercises, **challenges will be graded**. The following rubrics define how you will be graded, both on an individual and team basis.

## Individual
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Effort | Some task __q__'s left unattempted | All task __q__'s attempted |
| Observed | Did not document observations | Documented observations based on analysis |
| Supported | Some observations not supported by analysis | All observations supported by analysis (table, graph, etc.) |
| Code Styled | Violations of the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) hinder readability | Code sufficiently close to the [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) |

## Team
<!-- ------------------------- -->

| Category | Unsatisfactory | Satisfactory |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Documented | No team contributions to Wiki | Team contributed to Wiki |
| Referenced | No team references in Wiki | At least one reference in Wiki to member report(s) |
| Relevant | References unrelated to assertion, or difficult to find related analysis based on reference text | Reference text clearly points to relevant analysis |

## Due Date
<!-- ------------------------- -->

All the deliverables stated in the rubrics above are due on the day of the class discussion of that exercise. See the [Syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jJTh2DH8nVJd2eyMMoyNGroReo0BKcJrz1eONi3rPSc/edit?usp=sharing) for more information.

# Data Exploration
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this first stage, you will explore the `diamonds` dataset and document your observations.

__q1__ Create a plot of `price` vs `carat` of the `diamonds` dataset below. Document your observations from the visual.

*Hint*: We learned how to do this in `e-vis00-basics`!

```{r q1-task}
## TASK: Plot `price` vs `carat` below

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Diamond prices vs. carat values")

```

**Observations**:

- As one might expect, a higher carat value means, roughly, that the price of the diamond will be higher, but with variation due (probably) to those other "C" variables: clarity, color, and cut.
- There is some interesting clustering happening though, with a lot more diamonds falling right above 2 carats than right below, it seems. When I did the first exercise, I wrote, "This makes me wonder how carats work, OR if there is something about this dataset that would have selected for these differently..." But now that I have read the Wikipedia bit about "carat over cut," I see that there is a lot more human intervention in determining the carat value than I would have otherwise guessed. For whatever reason (ease of filtering? A human tendency to discount fractional values like 1.1 as "basically 1"--and thus not worth an increased price over a 1 carat diamond?), it seems that the people who cut diamonds are optimizing for carat values of 1, 1.5, 2, etc.--or very close to those values, anyway.
- There seems to be some clipping happening with the price, as well--I would guess this dataset pulled a set of diamonds under a particular price point, or a set of diamonds starting with the least expensive and ending at a certain number of diamonds (53,940?). I know they can cost more than $20k in the real world... 


__q2__ Create a visualization showing variables `carat`, `price`, and `cut` simultaneously. Experiment with which variable you assign to which aesthetic (`x`, `y`, etc.) to find an effective visual.

```{r q2-task}
## TASK: Plot `price`, `carat`, and `cut` below

ggplot(diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  labs(title = "Diamond prices vs. carat values and cuts")

#ggplot(diamonds) +
#  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = cut, y = carat))

```

**Observations**:

Before I learned about the way carats are prioritized, I wrote the following:

- Obviously cut also has a relationship to price--the better the cut (for a given carat value), generally the higher the price.
- But, there are a lot of points (it seems) that do not clearly fit this pattern... 

But now, 

- It does seem that Ideal cuts are more concentrated in the lower-carat diamonds, and poorer quality cuts dominate the higher-carat diamonds.

Additionally, I have questions! First, am I correct that there is clustering around integer carat values, and around 1.5 carats?

```{r}
carat_vector <- diamonds$carat
hist(x = carat_vector, breaks = 20)
```

- This confirms my suspicion about the clustering of diamonds around carat values of 1, 1.5, and 2, but the resolution is a bit low (and I may not be doing my histogram correctly, but I can't seem to get more than 4 breaks per carat here).

Are there other clusters in the lower-carat value diamonds?

```{r}
diamonds_up_to_2 <- filter(diamonds, carat <= 2)
carat_vector_up_to_2 <- diamonds_up_to_2$carat
hist(x = carat_vector_up_to_2, breaks = 24) 

ggplot(diamonds_up_to_2) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
  labs(title = "Diamond price by carat (up to 2) and cut")

```

- Yes, I think I am seeing multiple clusters when I look more closely at the lower-carat value diamonds. There is very clearly one around 0.3 carats (I wonder if this is a good carat weight for e.g. pave diamonds?), probably one around 0.5 carats, and another at 0.7 carats (or so; I'm not being terribly precise here).
- The shape of this histogram is not what I would have guessed before I learned about how the carat value of a diamond is determined. (I would have expected a normal distribution, I think, not all these spikes.)

Next, what's happening above 2 carats?

```{r}
diamonds_2plus <- filter(diamonds, carat >= 2)
carat_vector_2plus <- diamonds_2plus$carat
hist(x = carat_vector_2plus, breaks = 24)
```

There are not many diamonds with a carat value higher than 3 in this dataset. Let's set those aside and focus on the 2-3 carat diamonds.

```{r}
diamonds_2_to_3 <- filter(diamonds, carat >= 2 & carat <= 3)
carat_vector_2_to_3 <- diamonds_2_to_3$carat
hist(x = carat_vector_2_to_3, breaks = 20)
```

- In my histogram, I see the cluster of diamonds at 2 carats, and it looks like I do have a smallish cluster at 2.5, but this is so subtle as to perhaps be noise--the trend seems stronger in the 1-2 carat diamonds. Hypothesis: Above 2 carats, you might as well go up to 3, psychologically speaking? But when you're in the normal-people range of less than 2 carats, 1.5 is a substantial jump from 1, and thus feels more worthwhile...? 


**But what about cut?**

If I filter the dataset by cut, do other patterns emerge?

```{r}
ideal_diamonds <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Ideal")
ggplot(ideal_diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Ideal cut diamonds: prices vs. carat values")+
  xlim(0,5)
# I don't know how to adjust the axis bounds here, and I wish I could make the x-axis extend to 4.5 or so for all of these; I just don't know how and have not yet bothered to look. :) 

premium_diamonds <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Premium")
ggplot(premium_diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Premium cut diamonds: prices vs. carat values")

vgood_diamonds <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Very Good")
ggplot(vgood_diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Very Good cut diamonds: prices vs. carat values")

good_diamonds <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Good")
ggplot(good_diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Good cut diamonds: prices vs. carat values")

fair_diamonds <- filter(diamonds, cut == "Fair")
ggplot(fair_diamonds) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = carat, y = price)) +
  labs(title = "Fair cut diamonds: prices vs. carat values")

```

**Observations**:

- These plots do end up looking quite different. This surprises me a little bit.

# Communication
<!-- -------------------------------------------------- -->

In this next stage, you will render your data exploration, push it to GitHub to share with others, and link your observations within our [Data Science Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki).

__q3__ *Knit* your document in order to create a report.

You can do this by clicking the "Knit" button at the top of your document in RStudio.

![Terminal](./images/c00-knit.png)

This will create a local `.md` file, and RStudio will automatically open a preview window so you can view your knitted document.

__q4__ *Push* your knitted document to GitHub.

![Terminal](./images/c00-unstaged.png)

You will need to stage both the `.md` file, as well as the `_files` folder. Note that the `_files` folder, when staged, will expand to include all the files under that directory.

![Terminal](./images/c00-staged.png)

__q5__ *Document* your findings in our [Wiki](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Olin_Data_Science_Wiki). Work with your learning team to come to consensus on your findings.

The [Datasets](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Datasets) page contains lists all the datasets we've analyzed together.

__q6__ *Prepare* to present your team's findings!

__q7__ Add a link to your personal data-science repository on the [Repositories](https://olin-data-science.fandom.com/wiki/Repositories) page. Make sure to file it under your team name!
